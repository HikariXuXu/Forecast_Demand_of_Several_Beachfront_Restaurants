# Forecast_Demand_of_Several_Beachfront_Restaurants
This is a kaggle competition of INFO 558 at WashU. It is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. My task is to forecast demand for four beach front restaurants with a variety of items for sale.

Given 2.75 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 10 different items at 5 different restaurants. The data set contains both structured and unstructured elements.
